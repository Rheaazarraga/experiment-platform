<h2 align="center"> Pretend Platformer ðŸ‘¾ðŸŽ®ðŸ•¹</h2>

---

Part of my ultimate developer dream is to gain experience in the gaming industry. I'm a huge fan of platform, rogue-like, and RPG games and have always been curious to know what it would be like to create my own game.

Since graduating fom bootcamp, I've been eager to explore major platforms used in game development such as Unity and Unreal Engine, as well as pixel animation/ sprite creation tools. Today I finished an introduction to Unity and made my first ever 2D scene. I'm looking forward to continuing this course, exercise my creative muscles, and create more passion projects!
